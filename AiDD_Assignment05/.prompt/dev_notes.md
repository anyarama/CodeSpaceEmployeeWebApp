## Entry 1 — Scaffolding & Project Setup
**Prompt Given:**  
"Create the initial structure for a multi-page responsive portfolio site using semantic HTML, external CSS, and accessible JavaScript."

**AI Output Summary:**  
The AI scaffolded the 6-page structure with header/footer templates, responsive CSS links, and accessibility landmarks already wired in.

**Action Taken:**  
Accepted structure with minor adjustments (renamed files, refined nav links, added custom color palette).

**Reflection:**  
The AI accelerated setup by producing a clean semantic scaffold. I reviewed accessibility landmarks and verified all file paths manually.

## Entry 2 — Design Refinement & Styling
**Prompt Given:**  
"Make the website look modern and professional with consistent spacing, color palette, and font hierarchy."

**AI Output Summary:**  
AI generated a CSS design system with consistent spacing scale, Inter font, and WCAG-compliant colors.

**Action Taken:**  
Accepted core CSS but customized font weights, spacing, and gradients for better visual rhythm.

**Reflection:**  
This stage taught me how modular design systems streamline styling while ensuring consistency across pages.

## Entry 3 — Contact Form Validation Logic
**Prompt Given:**  
"Add accessible form validation with email format checking, password confirmation, and redirect to thankyou.html."

**AI Output Summary:**  
The AI provided a JavaScript module using `aria-live` feedback, regex-based email validation, and success redirect handling.

**Action Taken:**  
Implemented the logic, tested edge cases, tightened name/password regex, and synchronized error messaging with HTML patterns.

## Final Reflection
Working alongside AI sped up everything from scaffolding to accessibility audits. I relied on generated templates for the initial structure, then exercised judgment to personalise navigation, tune typography, and enforce stricter validation rules. Modern best practices—like skip links, reduced-motion handling, and semantic landmark usage—surfaced quickly because the AI surfaced patterns I might have researched manually. Throughout, I manually reviewed every snippet to ensure correct file paths, appropriate ARIA usage, and maintainable CSS structure. When the AI’s defaults felt too generic, I iterated: rewrote copy to match my voice, swapped gradients to fit the dark theme, and updated regexes to reflect stronger password policies. That back-and-forth balance let me finish faster without surrendering ownership of the creative and technical decisions. In short, AI handled repetitive scaffolding while I guarded polish, compliance, and personal tone—resulting in a professional, rubric-ready portfolio.

I relied on generated templates for the initial structure, then exercised judgment to personalise navigation, tune typography, and enforce stricter validation rules. Modern best practices—like skip links, reduced-motion handling, and semantic landmark usage—surfaced quickly because the AI surfaced patterns I might have researched manually. Still, I inspected every snippet, confirming that file paths resolved, aria attributes were appropriate, and the CSS stayed maintainable.
