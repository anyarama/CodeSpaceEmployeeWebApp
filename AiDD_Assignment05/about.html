              <p class="lead">My "aha moment" came at 2 AM on a Tuesday, staring at a spreadsheet with 127 different material numbers for the same product. That's when I realized: <strong>bad data doesn't just slow companies down—it paralyzes decision-making</strong>.</p>
              
              <p>I'm Aneesh Yaramati, and that chaotic spreadsheet at Schlumberger launched my obsession with data engineering. Over two years, I consolidated 10+ legacy systems into a single source of truth—40 million records that teams could finally trust. But the real win wasn't the technology; it was watching procurement teams stop second-guessing every number and start making confident decisions.</p>
              
              <h2>Why Data Engineering?</h2>
              
              <p>Most people see data engineering as plumbing—necessary but unglamorous. I see it differently. Every ETL pipeline I build, every validation rule I write, removes friction from someone's day. When data "just works," analysts spend time discovering insights instead of debugging discrepancies. Product managers make decisions based on truth, not hunches.</p>
              
              <p>At Schlumberger, I didn't just move data—I built systems that teams actually used. My validation frameworks caught errors before they became million-dollar mistakes. My archival workflows improved system reliability by 20%. But what I'm proudest of? The thank-you emails from analysts who said, "This is the first time I trust these numbers."</p>
              
              <h2>The Kelley Chapter</h2>
              
              <p>Now I'm at Kelley School of Business, and here's why: I'm good at building data systems, but I want to be great at building data systems that drive business value. There's a gap between "technically correct" and "strategically brilliant," and I'm here to close it.</p>
              
              <p>I'm combining my enterprise engineering experience with modern AI tools, business strategy, and product thinking. The goal? To bridge the gap between data teams and business stakeholders—speaking both languages fluently.</p>
              
              <h2>Current Focus Areas</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud Architecture:</strong> Mastering Azure and AWS to build scalable, cost-effective data platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Data Stack:</strong> Experimenting with dbt, Airflow, and Snowflake—moving beyond legacy tools</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Powered Development:</strong> Leveraging AI assistants while maintaining code quality and documentation standards</li>
                <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Contributing to data quality frameworks because better tools lift everyone</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Beyond the Terminal</h2>
              <p>When I close my laptop, you'll find me on Bloomington's trails with my camera, hunting for that perfect golden-hour shot. I'm also deep into books about systems thinking and software craftsmanship—because the best engineers never stop learning. And yes, I occasionally debug my own photography workflow scripts (old habits die hard).</p>
              
              <p><strong>Let's connect</strong> if you're working on data challenges, building at the intersection of data and product, or just want to talk about how to make systems that people actually enjoy using.</p>
