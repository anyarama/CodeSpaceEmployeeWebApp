# CodeSpace Employee Web App Workspace

This repository houses coursework and experiments completed while exploring AI-assisted development techniques. The primary project at the moment is the **AiDD Assignment 05** personal portfolio site located in `AiDD_Assignment05/`.

## Repository Layout

- `AiDD_Assignment05/` – Multi-page personal portfolio website that fulfils the Assignment 05 rubric, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets, and AI prompt documentation.
- `cursor-day01/` – Scratch space and quick prototypes created while testing the Cursor IDE workflow. (Content is intentionally lightweight and may evolve.)

## Working With The Portfolio Project

1. `cd AiDD_Assignment05`
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, **or** run the lightweight preview server:
   ```bash
   python mcp_server.py --port 8000
   ```
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to browse the site locally.

The project includes a detailed README inside the `AiDD_Assignment05/` folder with full documentation, testing guidance, and rubric compliance notes.

## Tooling & AI Usage

- Development performed on macOS using Cursor / VS Code alongside CLI tooling.
- AI assistance leveraged primarily through Claude and GitHub Copilot for scaffolding, validation logic, and content refinement.
- Prompts, outputs, and reflections for graded work are logged in `AiDD_Assignment05/.prompt/dev_notes.md`.

## Future Plans

- Expand the repo with additional assignments and experiments.
- Continue documenting AI-assisted workflows to track learning progress.
- Integrate automated validation (HTML/CSS linters) as the projects grow.
