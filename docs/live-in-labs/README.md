# Live-in-Labs Automation Initiative Playbook

Field notes and supporting documents for the rural micro-manufacturing project featured in the portfolio.

## Project Objectives

- Increase production throughput for areca-leaf plates without compromising craftsmanship.
- Design machinery that local artisans can fabricate, operate, and maintain.
- Create documentation that supports knowledge transfer and sustainable ownership.

## Contents

These resources are stored privately because they include student IP and community partner data. To request access for academic evaluation, reach out at `anyarama@iu.edu`.

## Lessons Learned

1. Co-create with the communityâ€”design decisions were validated on-site each sprint.
2. Document everything; even short field notes helped when transferring knowledge.
3. Build maintenance into the solution so the community stays self-sufficient.
