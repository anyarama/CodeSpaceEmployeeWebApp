# Pothole Detection System â€” Case Study

This companion note summarises the deep-learning project showcased on the portfolio site.

## Highlights

- **Objective:** Real-time pothole detection on Indian roads to improve driver safety.
- **Dataset:** 1,995 labelled roadway images with diverse lighting and weather.
- **Model:** YOLOv5m (best balance of latency vs. accuracy); precision/recall tuned through anchor optimisation.
- **Stack:** Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Albumentations.
- **Results:** 82% detection accuracy with 30 FPS inference on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

## Repository Status

The production code and dataset are held in a private client repository because of licensing restrictions. For academic review, please contact `anyarama@iu.edu` to obtain redacted notebooks, evaluation scripts, and presentation material.
